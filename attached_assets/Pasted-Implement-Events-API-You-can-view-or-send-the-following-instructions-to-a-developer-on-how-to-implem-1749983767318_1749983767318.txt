1. Generate access token
An access token gives you access to Events API. Each time you make a call, you're required to use your access token.
After a token is generated, make sure to copy it. For security, TikTok won't save the token.
Generate access token
Please copy and save this token somewhere safe. It won't be stored by Tiktok.

Copy
2. Send events through the API
Now that you have a token, choose events you want to send from your server. We recommend choosing at least 3 events. You'll also need to make a request and set up your payload.
Make a POST request
To send new events, make a POST request to this API's endpoint from this path:/open_api/v1.3/event/track/
When you post to this edge, TikTok creates new server events.
3. Build a payload
View how your payload should be structured. You can also use Payload Helper to check if there's any issues by creating a sample payload for your events.
