How to Set Up and Verify TikTok Web Data Connection
Last updated: April 2025
TikTok for Business offers tools that allow businesses to share marketing data with TikTok for measurement and ad performance. These data connections can be setup for web via a TikTok Pixel or Events API integration.


Both options are available via selected third party partners or through a manual setup.

TikTok Pixel is a piece of code that you can place on your website that allows you to share website events with TikTok. Learn more about TikTok Pixel.

TikTok Events API provides advertisers with a reliable connection between TikTok and advertiser's marketing data, across web, app, and offline (eg. Store, CRM) channels with the ability to customize the information they share with TikTok. Learn more about Events API
